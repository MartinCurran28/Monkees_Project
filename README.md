"A good coder is a lazy coder." Those words from a previous lesson echoed through my mind for two weeks
while creating this page for The Monkees. I think the nice thing about coding, 
in my limited experience, is that there are examples everywhere which fit a mood 
and inspire. I think it was Jim Jarmusch who said borrow from wherever you like 
as long as it speaks to you, and in that I think borrowing from what I like and what 
I think appeals to people is important as long as I make it my own. 


My vision for the home page was to try and do two ting: One, make it clear how to navigate
the site and two to impart the image the band represents with their logo and give a short 
introduction of who they are. if the user should change site after onlt the home page, at least the image of that band's 
logo, which i think iconic on its own, will stay in their head and I think that's something which 
will make them return if continue viewing the site.
Instead of a navbar, I opted to choose buttons for the header. To me, it comes across 
more modern and I think for an ageing band that's important in their online presence.
The header itself is something of a reference to The Beatles' Hard Day's Night album.
I think repeating the image makes it seem almost kaledoscopic and still very 60s, 
but still tasteful. Gor the general font and colouring I thought the 60's rainbow feel 
was too childish so I opted for blues and whites which I think evoke something softer 
on the eye, but maintain a serious image. I wanted it to be simple. Not to overload the user.
